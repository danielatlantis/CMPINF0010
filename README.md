## Skills Lab 7 
Tristan Zuroski and Daniel Antantis  
This is a simple trivia game designed to allow users multiple attempts to answer questions and for each question answered correctly their score will be updated and saved. The game is meant to be pointless and trivial so have fun!


## License
I chose the MIT License because it is enabling anyone permission to use my software without any restrictions so long as they provide the former copyrite documentation in their code as well. It also provides a clear statement stating that I am not liable for any misuse or damages that may come from my code so therefore I am not worried about anyone maliantly using it and then facing repercussions.

## Code of Conduct
I went with the Contributor Covenant code of conduct because as we discussed it is the most widespread code of conduct used, I therefore researched it further and found that the documentation covered relatively all causes for concern. As this code of conduct gives the community leader (In this case that is me) the outright authority to remove anything I may deem unacceptable in accordance to the guidelines. On top of that it also allows the leader to ban users given proper cause. All in all, I believe this code of conduct provides me with complete control over my product and who I may deem worthy of using it in a certain manner.
